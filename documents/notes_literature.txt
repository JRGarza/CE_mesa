Notes on Bodenheimer & Taam (1984):

From intro, our code is a solid improvement over 1D codes
	- Angular momentum transport in particular
	- May break down when “companion is deep inside
		the envelope” so there is “insufficient time for
		circulation currents, convective transport, or
		instabilities to redistribute the energy and 
		angular momentum in spherical shells”
	- More subtle differences - opacity tables, reaction
		networks	

- 2D - only 50x50 or 70x70 grid cells
- *** use self-gravity *** - use Poisson’s equation for potential
	- Bodenheimer & Woosley (1983) - 2D SN code
- artificial viscosity for treatment of shocks
- Crazy outer boundary condition - only modeling a small 
	portion of the giant star
- Outward radial flow acceleration occurs near stellar surface

- Test 1: NS went from 3.87e11 to 3.78e11
- “In general, the envelope can accommodate the angular
	momentum lost from the orbital potion if it is transferred
	outward toward the stellar surface. However, if uniform
	specific angular momentum throughout the entire 
	envelope is assumed, with overall conservation of 
	angular momentum from the orbital decay, an unphysical
	situation occurs once the neutron star has spiraled deep
	into the envelope because eventually the relative velocity
	between the neutron star orbit and the local region of the
	envelope goes to zero.” pg(5-6)
- In their 1D tests, energy only required subsonic advection
- The envelope ejection conclusion is based on the velocities
	- Their “long” run seems to confirm - still don’t run to
		envelope ejection
- Test 2: super-sonic radial velocities
	- Higher enthalpy, heat capacities at higher densities, so
		higher density material can advect more heat
		at slower velocities.
- Envelope can adjust, without ejecting

Discussion
- Advection of energy is more important than radiative diffusion
- Energy efficiently transfers from orbital to gas kinetic
- I wonder: Do we need self-gravity to see equatorial outflow?
- z-axis redistribution of angular momentum is slow
	- Timescale for readjustment is long
	- Kippenhahn & Thomas (1981)

Comments: 
Clearly 2D (and 3D) effects are important, but complete physics is not possible. We should discuss stellar rotation - specifically how MESA’s implementation of sheller rotation makes Bodenheimer & Taam (1984)’s pessimism inapplicable. Need to show a calculation for angular momentum and energy transport timescale across a shell.
