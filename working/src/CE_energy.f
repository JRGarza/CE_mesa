      ! NOTE: if you'd like to have some inlist controls for your routine,
      ! you can use the x_ctrl array of real(dp) variables that is in &controls
      ! e.g., in the &controls inlist, you can set
      !     x_ctrl(1) = <my_special_param>
      ! where <my_special_param> is a real value such as 0d0 or 3.59d0
      ! Then in your routine, you can access that by
      !     s% x_ctrl(1)
      ! of course before you can use s, you need to get it using the id argument.
      ! here's an example of how to do that -- add these lines at the start of your routine:
      !         use star_lib, only: star_ptr
      !         type (star_info), pointer :: s
      !         call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
      !         if (ierr /= 0) then ! OOPS
      !            return
      !         end if
      ! 
      ! for integer control values, you can use x_integer_ctrl
      ! for logical control values, you can use x_logical_ctrl

      use star_def

      implicit none
      
            
      contains
      
      
      subroutine CE_inject_energy(id, ierr)
         use const_def, only: Rsun
         integer, intent(in) :: id
         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
         type (star_info), pointer :: s
         integer :: k
         ierr = 0
         call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
         if (ierr /= 0) return
         s% extra_heat(:) = 0.0d0
         ! here is an example of calculating extra_heat for each cell.
         do k = 1, s% nz
            if (s% r(k) > 10.*Rsun .and. s% r(k) < 20.*Rsun) then
               !#CE: Note that "extra_heat" is the specific energy added to the the specific cell in
               ! units of erg/s/gr
               s% extra_heat(k) = 1d5
            end if
         end do
      end subroutine CE_inject_energy


      end module CE_energy
