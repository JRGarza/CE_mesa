This file contains a list of variables saved by the star. These modules are starting to get complicated enough that conflicts are now possible.

Inlist controls
x_ctrl(1) = 3.1687536e+38    CE_energy_rate: The rate at which energy is deposited in the star
                                in units of erg/s.
                                
x_ctrl(2) = 20.1             CE_companion_position: The distance of the center of the companion
                                star from the center of the donor star in solar radii
                             
x_ctrl(3) = 0.5d0            initial CE_companion_radius: The radius of the companion star in solar radii

x_ctrl(4) = 0.319d0          CE_companion_mass: The mass of the companion star in solar masses

x_ctrl(5) = 0.2d0            CE_n_acc_radii: Number of accretion radii away from companion star to deposit
                                heating into the star from orbital energy
                            
x_ctrl(8) = 1d-5             Fractional orbital energy change allowed per step
x_ctrl(9) = 1d-5             Fractional orbital separation change allowed per step
x_ctrl(10) = 1d-5            Fractional orbital angular momentum change allowed per step


x_integer_ctrl(1) = 4        1: Uniform heating of the whole envelope.
                             2: Heating only in the position of the companion in the region 
                                around the companion using the accretion radius.
                             3: CE_energy_rate is calculated based on the companion's position
                                and the gravitational drag prescription by Eve Ostriker (1999).
                                This calculation currently does not work.
                             4: CE_energy_rate is calculated from fitting formula based on
                                simulations by Morgan MacLeod and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz.

x_logical_ctrl(1) = .false.  include_internal_energy: If true, then the internal energy is included when
                                when the outer parts of the envelope are bound or unbound.
